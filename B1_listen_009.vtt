00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.863
Tech Talk Today podcast I'm your host Alex Taylor and

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:13.575
with me today we have a very special guest Let's

00:00:13.588 --> 00:00:17.163
give a warm welcome to Dr Jane Smith a renowned

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.750
environmental scientist and the lead researcher of the Green Future

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:28.450
project Applauding continues DR JANE SMITH Thank you Alex It's

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:33.325

00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:36.888
So to start off could you tell our listeners a

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.538
little bit about your background and how you got into

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.575
environmental science DR JANE SMITH Certainly Alex I've always been

00:00:46.587 --> 00:00:50.737
passionate about nature and the environment I pursued a degree

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.200
in environmental science and after completing my Ph.D. I focused

00:00:56.212 --> 00:01:00.737
on researching sustainable solutions for climate change That's when I

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.862
came up with the Green Future project ALEX Fascinating And

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.638
what is the main goal of the Green Future project

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.888
DR JANE SMITH The main goal is to develop innovative

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.812
eco-friendly technologies that can help reduce our carbon footprint and

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:22.775
promote a greener future for everyone ALEX That sounds incredibly

00:01:22.787 --> 00:01:26.237
ambitious Can you give us an example of one of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.350
these technologies DR JANE SMITH Absolutely One of our recent

00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:37.350
breakthroughs is a solar-powered water purifier It's designed to provide

00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:41.338
clean drinking water to remote communities while using renewable energy

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.700
ALEX That's amazing What are some of the other projects

00:01:46.713 --> 00:01:50.862
your team is working on DR JANE SMITH We're also

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:55.250
developing a system to convert agricultural waste into biofuels which

00:01:55.263 --> 00:02:00.088
could significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels Plus we're

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.475
exploring ways to make urban environments more sustainable through green

00:02:03.487 --> 00:02:08.650
architecture and smart city technologies ALEX It sounds like you

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:12.825
and your team are making a real impact Dr Smith

00:02:13.137 --> 00:02:15.900
